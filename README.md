***Facebook Project***
***Created by: Omer kriger and Nir Peretz***

In this project Omer and I created an OOP based facebook like program.
Our main goal was to practice the principles of OOP in C++.
In our program we used:
- Varies classes which includs: members, fan pages, etc.
- We practiced the principle of polymorphism, it can be seen in the class "Status".
- Exeptions, we made sure that every input that the user might enter will be dealt with and his expirience won't be effected.

It was a fun and educating project, we hope you'll enjoy reading and trying it.
